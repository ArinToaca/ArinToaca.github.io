I am once again rebuilding my website, but this time, I'll stick with this theme, I promise!
I'll leave these instructions here for when I forget them, feel free to copy this theme for your own website :D

Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:

`YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP`

Where `YEAR` is a four-digit number, `MONTH` and `DAY` are both two-digit numbers, and `MARKUP` is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight python %}
def print_hi(name)
  set_here = {'a','b','c'}
  d = {1:2,2:2}
  d[1] = 1 # mumbo jumbo
  d = set(set_here)
  print(f"Hi, {name}")

print_hi('Arin')
#=> prints 'Hi, Arin' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}
